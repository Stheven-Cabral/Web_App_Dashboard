<h2>Web App Dashboard</h2>

A responsive dashboard I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used inline SVG's in order to customize icon fills and paths. In addition, I used the chart.js library to create line, bar, and pie chart widgets. The project focused on creating tables, charts, and graphics and other interactive user components.
